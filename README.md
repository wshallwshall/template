# PowerVibe for Cursor (PV-C)

**A turnkey project template for Cursor IDE users doing Vibe coding**

PowerVibe for Cursor (PV-C) is a complete project scaffolding template that provides a solid foundation for starting new development projects in Cursor IDE. Instead of piecing together individual rules, this template offers a comprehensive starting point with best-practice rules and documentation templates for any major language or framework.

## üöÄ Why PowerVibe for Cursor?

### **Simple to Use, Fast and Consistent Start**
- **Create Project Folder** - Set up your new project directory
- **Copy the template contents** - Copy all template files to your project
- **Customize Rules** - Tell Cursor's AI to adjust the rules for your target language and framework (See the Quick Start section for suggested prompts)
- **Use Project Docs Templates** - Ask the AI to review the templates in the docs/templates folder and recommend which are essential for a solid start 

### **General Goodness**
- **No Configuration Overhead**: Pre-configured rules for immediate productivity
- **Consistent Foundation**: Every project starts with the same high-quality base

### **Improved Development Outcomes**
- **Best Practice Enforcement**: Built-in rules ensure code quality, security, and performance
- **Consistent Standards**: Uniform approach across all projects and team members
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Proactive patterns prevent common development pitfalls

### **Enhanced AI Collaboration**
- **Optimized AI Responses**: Rules guide Cursor's AI to provide better, more consistent suggestions
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: AI understands your project structure and coding standards
- **Reduced Prompt Engineering**: Less time spent crafting prompts, more time coding

### **Cost Optimization**
- **Fewer Prompts Needed**: Comprehensive rules reduce the number of AI interactions required
- **Higher Quality Output**: Better AI responses mean fewer iterations and corrections
- **Faster Development**: Streamlined workflow accelerates project delivery

## üöÄ Quick Start

> **üìù Note on File Sizes**: The rule files in this template are intentionally large (some over 50KB) because they contain comprehensive examples for all supported languages and frameworks. Don't worry about the size - once you customize the template for your specific language/framework using the prompts below, the AI will remove all irrelevant content, dramatically reducing file sizes to only what you need.

### **1. Create Your Project**
```bash
# Create a new project folder
mkdir my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project

# Copy template contents
cp -r /path/to/PowerVibe-for-Cursor/* .
```

### **2. Open in Cursor IDE**
```bash
# Open the project in Cursor
cursor .
```

### **3. Customize for Your Project**
Use these prompts to customize the template for your specific needs:

#### **Language & Framework Selection**
```
I'm starting a new project using [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]. Please customize the Cursor rules by:
1. Removing references to languages and frameworks I'm not using
2. Keeping only the rules relevant to [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]
3. Updating any language-specific examples to use [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]
4. Ensuring all security, testing, and performance patterns are appropriate for [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]
```

#### **Documentation Setup**
```
I need help setting up documentation for my [PROJECT_TYPE] project. Please:
1. Review the docs/templates/ folder and recommend which templates I should use
2. Copy the recommended templates to the main docs/ folder
3. Help me populate the templates with my project's specific information
4. Create a documentation structure that matches my project's needs
```

#### **Project-Specific Customization**
```
My project is a [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION] using [TECH_STACK]. Please:
1. Customize the rules to focus on [SPECIFIC_NEEDS]
2. Update examples to reflect [DOMAIN/INDUSTRY] best practices
3. Adjust security requirements for [DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT]
4. Optimize performance guidelines for [SCALE/LOAD_REQUIREMENTS]
```
